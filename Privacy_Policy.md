# Privacy Policy for Passepartout
1. Data Collection
Passepartout collects only the minimal data necessary for its operation. This includes:
Server ID: To identify which server the bot is operating on.
Member ID: To manage user interactions within the server.
No additional personal data is collected or stored. The bot does not access private messages or other sensitive information from users.
2. Data Storage
Passepartout does not store or log any data permanently, except for server and user identification, which is necessary to ensure the bot’s functionality.
No conversation logs or user data (outside of the server/member IDs) are retained after interactions with the bot.
3. Data Sharing
Passepartout does not share any collected data with third parties.
There is no exchange of data between servers or users. Each server’s data is isolated and only used for the operations within that specific server.
4. Third-Party Access
No third parties have access to or are provided with any data collected by Passepartout. All data remains within the Discord ecosystem and is used solely to enhance the user experience within your server.
5. Security
All interactions with Passepartout are handled via Discord’s secure infrastructure. While we make every effort to maintain security, please note that data transmission over the internet can never be completely secure.
We rely on Discord’s security measures to protect user data.
6. User Rights
Users may request the removal of their data (server or member ID) from Passepartout at any time. This will only affect the functionality of the bot in relation to the server in which the data is used.
7. Purchases and Payments
Purchases made through Passepartout are processed through Discord’s official payment systems, and no payment data is collected or stored by the bot itself.
Passepartout does not have access to any payment or credit card information.
8. Policy Changes
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be communicated via an update in the bot’s documentation. Continued use of Passepartout after any changes signifies your acceptance of the updated policy.
